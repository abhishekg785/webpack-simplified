webpcack simplified
---------------
Simple webpack config and structure, nothing fancy!

Webpack is an awesome tool, I make the use of it on a regular basis in my web projects.

From helping in code-splitting to applying various other optimizations on build time, it's awesome!

This is a simple webpcack structure that I usually follow ( might change ), I like it, it's simple and gives
you flexibility.

It does not contain too much, plugins can be added and removed, I have focused more on the configuration and the structure.

Contents:
---------
It contains a webpack.config.js file which it present at the root of the project. This file is the entry point and responsible for creating
the final webpack config on the basis of the given env and presets.

build-utils dir contains all the code build related stuff, which is mainly webpack related stuff.
It contains:
    webpack.development.js ( webpack --env.mode development)
    webpack.production.js ( webpack --env.mode production )

So if you do:  `npm run build:dev` , make use of webpack.development.js
and same for `npm run build:prod`, make use of webpack.production.js

It also contains : loadPresets.js file, which is responsible for loading the presets you need.
It loads the presets from the `presets` dir present inside `build-utils` dir.

So for example, if you wanna analyze the modules in your project, simply add the `webpack.analyze.js` (with the webpack bundle analyzer plugin inside the file) inside `presets` dir,
and it will load from there given that you include it in the script like: `--presets analyze,

similarly for compress, add `webpack.compress.js` in `presets` dir, and it will be loaded from there using `--presets compress`.

So, `webpack --env.mode production --presets compress`, will apply compress preset in prod env.

You can also apply multiple presets at once like: `webpack --env.mode production --presets compress --presets analyze`

Check the `package.json` files for the used scripts.
